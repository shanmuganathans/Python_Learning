    "========\n",

    "immediately flushed (written) to the underlying file on the disk. By default, file I/O operations may be buffered, \n",
    "meaning that the data is first stored in a buffer in memory before being written to the actual file on disk. \n",
    "This buffering improves the performance of file operations as writing to disk can be a relatively slow process \n",
    "compared to writing to memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are scenarios where you may need to force the data to be written immediately to the file,\n",

    "without any delay, you can use the `flush()` method to ensure that the data is written right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `flush()` method is called on a file object and does not take any arguments. It simply flushes the buffered \n",
    "data to the file associated with that file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use the `flush()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "or for the buffer to be automatically flushed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that in many cases, the need to manually call `flush()` is rare since Python automatically flushes \n",
    "the buffer when the file is closed or when it becomes full. However, using `flush()` can be \n",
