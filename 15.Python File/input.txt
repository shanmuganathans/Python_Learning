Python allows you to read, write and delete files
    Use the function open("filename","w+") to create a file. 
    The + tells the python interpreter to open file with read and write permissions.
    To append data to an existing file use the command open("Filename", "a")
    Use the read function to read the ENTIRE contents of a file
    Use the readlines function to read the content of the file one by one.
