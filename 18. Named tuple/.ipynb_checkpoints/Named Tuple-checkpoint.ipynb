    "Advantages of Using Named Tuples:\n",
    "==================================\n",
    "Named tuples are a powerful feature in Python that allow us to create tuple subclasses with named fields. \n",
    "They provide an easy way to define simple classes without the overhead of defining a full class. In this section, \n",
    "we will discuss the advantages of using named tuples in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Readability and Maintainability: \n",
    "    Named tuples provide more readable and maintainable code as compared to regular tuples or dictionaries.\n",
    "    With named tuples, you can access the elements by their names instead of using index numbers.\n",
    "    This makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Immutable: \n",
    "        Like regular tuples, named tuples are immutable, which means that once they are created,\n",
    "        their values cannot be changed. This is an important feature when dealing with data that\n",
    "        should not be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Memory Efficient: \n",
    "        Named tuples are memory efficient as they do not require as much memory as regular classes. \n",
    "        This is because they use a single tuple instance to store the data for each instance of the named tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Default Values:\n",
    "        Named tuples allow you to set default values for their fields, which makes it easier \n",
    "        to handle missing data or optional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Unpacking: \n",
    "        Named tuples can be easily unpacked into separate variables,\n",
    "        just like regular tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, named tuples provide a convenient and efficient way to create simple classes with read-only \n",
    "attributes in Python. They offer better readability and maintainability than regular tuples or dictionaries,\n",
    "while also being memory-efficient and immutable.\n",
